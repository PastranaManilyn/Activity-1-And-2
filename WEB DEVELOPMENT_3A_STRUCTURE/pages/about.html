                    <p>The College of Information and Computing Sciences (CICS) is one of the premiere schools in
                        the province for IT education and services. It aims to produce competitive
                        IT professionals and IT-enabled individuals who will encourage real innovation for
                         advancements in the digital era of the province and the country.

                         <br>
                        The College was first established in 1998 at MSC Boac Campus through BOT Resolution No. 35. S. 1998 
                        as the Institute of Information and Computing Sciences (IICS), a special program to offer Associate 
                        degrees in Computer Technology (ACT). Believing that the province needs IT human resources, IICS was 
                        adopted as the School of Information and Computing Sciences (SICS), after two years, offering two emerging 
                        degree courses: Bachelor of Science in Information Management and Bachelor of Science in
                        Information Technology to cater to the graduates of ACT. The Bachelor of Science in Information Management 
                        (BSIM) was also offered at MSCâ€™s Sta. Cruz campus, while the Bachelor of Science in Information Management
                         was renamed Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS) in compliance with CHED 
                         Memorandum Order No. 53 series of 2006.</p>
